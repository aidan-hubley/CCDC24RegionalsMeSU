Palo Alto Firewalls 

https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ngfw 

IP: 172.20.242.150 (accessible from User zone.) 

Default – admin:Changeme123 

Tasks: 

Change password, disable extra accounts. 

Set correct access methods – only let User Zone access over SSH and HTTPS. 

Make sure the network zones are configured correctly: 

Internal: e1/2  172.20.240.254/24 

User: e1/4 172.20.242.254/24 

Public: e1/1  172.20.241.254/24 

External: (Assuming this is the 172.31.2x.1 if pinging from the workstation?) 

In qualifiers these were set up correctly; make sure they are actually correct if they are set up. 

Rules: 

For Scoring Services: 

Allow HTTP(S) from ANYWHERE to Splunk (172.20.241.20). 

Allow HTTP(S) from ANYWHERE to Ubuntu 18 Web (172.20.242.10) 

Allow HTTP(S) from ANYWHERE to CentOS 7 E-COMM (172.20.241.30) 

Allow HTTP(S) from ANYWHERE to Fedora 21 WebMail/WebApps (172.20.241.40) 

Allow SMTP from ANYWHERE to Fedora 21 WebMail/WebApps (172.20.241.40) 

Allow POP3 from ANYWHERE to Fedora 21 WebMail/WebApps (172.20.241.40) 

Allow DNS from ANYWHERE to Debian 10 DNS/NTP (172.20.240.20) 

Allow DNS from ANYWHERE to 2019 AD/DNS/DHCP (172.20.242.200) 

Allow NTP from ANYWHERE to Debian 10 DNS/NTP (172.20.240.20) 

Assuming Docker is working this time, we'll have to allow something to it depending on what it seems to be running. 

No idea what system is running FTP/TFTP...maybe Fedora WebApps?? 

Check the above to make sure something is hitting all the rules, otherwise disable. 

For Us Talking To Ourselves: 

Allow any from Internal/User/Public to External (for patches & maybe research) 

??? Allow DHCP from Internal/User/Public to 2019 AD/DNS/DHCP (172.20.242.200) ??? 

??? Allow AD from Internal/User/Public to 2019 AD/DNS/DHCP (172.20.242.200) ??? 

Put an allow all rule FROM US in here for testing to see what's hitting it before activating this configuration. 

Put an allow all rule FROM EXTERNAL in here for testing to see what's hitting it before activating this configuration. 

Block Everything: 

Block any from Internal/User/Public to Internal/User/Public (this way we can see if anything is hitting & fix it if so.) 

Block any from External to Internal/User/Public. 

After this is done, update the browser. 

Change password & disable extra accounts: 

In Web UI: 

Device > Administrators 

Defaults are good – None, Dynamic, Superuser, None 

Device > Setup > Management (Authentication settings – for session timeouts/max) 

In CLI: 

configure 

set mgt-config users (view users) 

set mgt-config users <username> password (set new password for user) 

delete mgt-config users <username> (delete user) 

set mgt-config users <username> permissions role-based superuser yes (new admin user) 

set deviceconfig setting management <username> -session max-session-count <0-4> (set max session count for username) 

set deviceconfig setting management <username> -session max-time <0, 60-1499> 

commit 

exit 

 

Set access methods: 

In Web UI: 

Device > Setup > Interfaces & select Management 

Set HTTPS, SSH, & ping; permitted IP addresses, and PA device's network info 

In CLI: 

configure 

show deviceconfig system service [shows what's enabled] 

set deviceconfig system service enable-http[s] or enable-ssh  [to enable] 

set deviceconfig system service disable-xxx [to disable] 

delete deviceconfig system permitted-ip <subnet to be removed> [to delete allowed IP] 

set deviceconfig system permitted-ip <subnet to be added> [add allowed IP] 

commit 

Network Zones: 

Web UI: 

Configure default route to Internet router: 

Network > Virtual Router. Select default. 

Static Routes. Select Add. Enter a name. Enter the route in the Destination field. 

Select IP Address radio button in Next Hop field. 

Enter IP address and netmask for your Internet gateway. 

Click OK. 

Configure zones: 

Select Network > Interfaces and select interface. 

Select the interface type. Maybe Layer3. 

On the Config tab, select Security Zone > New Zone. 

Name the zone. 

Select the default option under Virtual Router dropdown. 

Select the IPv4 tab and add the IP address/network mask ("public" IP). 

To be able to ping the interface: Advanced > Other Info; Management Profile; New Management Profile; add a name & select ping. 

This works the same for internal zones. 

CLI: 

Below are some possible ways commands start if we get really stuck. Ideally we want to get the GUI up and not try to do this from the command line. 

show network interface (this probably is the start of how to show them all?) 

set network interface 

Set zone <name> 

Set vsys <name> zone <name> 

Set up firewall rules: 

Web: 

Policies > Security click Add. 

Do all the normal stuff. 

Make sure that Log at session end is checked. 

Going out: You can add an Application Filter, set the Category to "general Internet," and add Internet and SSL as applications. 

You can run tests by clicking Device > Troubleshooting, select Security Policy Match, enter source/destination/protocol/application and hit Execute to see what rule it hits. 

CLI: 

> configure (press enter) 

# set rulebase security rules <name> from <source zone> to <destination zone> destination <ip> application <application> service <any/application-default/service name> action <allow/deny> (press enter) 

commit 

# exit 

Example: 

# set rulebase security rules Generic-Security from Outside-L3 to Inside-L3 destination 63.63.63.63 application web-browsing service application-default action allow 

To see what's currently active: 

> show running security-policy 

> show config running (for everything) 

show rulebase security rules <rulename> 

delete rulebase security rules <rulename> 

Use ? Or tab to get command help. 

Logs: 

Web: 

Monitor > Logs 

To change columns: Click the arrow to the right of any column header & click Columns. 

Click spyglass for detailed info about log. 

Filter Logs: 

All of these need parentheses around them, I think. 

Some templates: 

addr.src in x.x.x.x[/x] 

addr.dst in x.x.x.x[/x] 

!(addr in x.x.x.x) 

zone.src eq zone_a 

zone.dst eq zone_a 

port.src eq aa 

port.dst eq aa 

receive_time leq 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss' 

receive_time geq 'yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss' 

  (interface.src eq 'ethernet1/x') 

 (action neq deny) 

(action eq allow) 

Click the filter button. Click a connector. Click an attribute. Then the other stuff populates. 

CLI:
